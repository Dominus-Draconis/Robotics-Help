# The Interview
![Interview Rubric](/assets/interview-rubric.png)

[Rubrics](https://github.com/Dominus-Draconis/Robotics-Help/blob/main/Notebook-and-Interview/rubrics.pdf)
As a team look over and discuss the team interview Rubric, this will help give you an idea of what to talk about.

[Judge Guide](https://github.com/Dominus-Draconis/Robotics-Help/blob/main/Notebook-and-Interview/judge-guide.pdf)
It can also be helpful to look over the judge guide to help prepare. The judges guide contains more detailed specifics of what the judges are looking for in particular awards and has some example interview questions that it can be helpful to look over for an idea of what the judges might ask you.

I would recommend assigning certain topics to the different members of your team. This will help ensure everyone speaks for similar lengths of time and will help minimize interruptions.

Make sure to introduce yourself to the judges, just your names are enough, but it can be helpful to also state your roles, e.g. builder, programmer, driver, scribe

The judges often ask the first question “So, tell us about your robot”, make sure you prepare for this type of open ended question and make sure to also be prepared for follow up questions about your specific answers.
   
## Topic 1
**Design process and Engineering Notebook**

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Design process and Engineering Notebook | Students **clearly explain all aspects of the design process** and how they recorded their use of the design process in the Notebook. | Students can **explain most aspects of the design process** and how they recorded their use of the process. | Students **can explain only limited aspects of the design** process and how they recorded their use of the process. |

### Students clearly explain all aspects of the design process
Talk about your design process, or how you went from brainstorming to choosing a design to building the design. You can explain how you brainstormed designs then choose between them with a decision matrix. I would recommend the person who writes your notebook talking about this topic as they probably know the most about it.

## Topic 2
**Game strategies and robot designs**

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Game strategies and robot designs | Students can describe **three or more game strategies** and robot designs that were considered; students can fully explain how and why the current game strategy and robot design were chosen. | Students can describe **two game strategies** and robot designs that were considered; students can explain how and why the current game strategy or robot design were chosen. | Students can describe **only their current game strategy** and design, or they cannot explain how and why the current game strategy or robot design were chosen. |

### Students can describe three or more game strategies
Make sure to mention at least 3 game strategies, these will be the ones you hopefully recorded at the beginning of your notebook. My team always likes to say *“our first strategy is, …”* to make it clear to the judges what we are doing.

If there are strategies that you considered but don’t use, talk about them and why you don’t use them, for example if you don’t play defense, you could talk about how you are bad at driving defense or your chassis is too slow to stop robots, or your chassis is too weak to push robots. My team usually has each person responsible for saying a strategy when the time is right in conversation

### Students can describe three or more robot designs that were considered
Also mention at least 3 robot designs that you considered, including your current one, again these should be in your notebook’s brainstorming at the beginning. Talk about why those designs wouldn’t be as effective or talk about old designs you tried but didn’t work. My team had one person explain all the robot designs.

## Topic 3
**Project and team management**

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Project and team management | Students can explain **how team progress was tracked against an overall project timeline**, and how students were assigned to tasks based on their skills and availability; students can explain management of material resources. | Students can explain **how team progress was monitored**, or how students were assigned to tasks, or management of material resources. | Students **cannot explain how team progress was monitored** or how students were assigned to tasks or how material resources were managed. |

### Students can explain how progress was tracked against an overall project timeline.
Talk about the timelines you should have included in your notebook and how you use these to maximize your time. For example, you could mention how at the beginning of each meeting you look at what the timeline says your goal is for the meeting and reassess the goal to track your progress.

### Students can explain management of materials and students.
Talk about how each person on your team’s time was managed well, for example, maybe your main builder was working on the chassis while the programmer war programing. Also talk about how you managed if certain team members were absent. Mention any problems you might have had with not finding the parts you need or how you planned out getting the parts you need.

## Topic 4
**Teamwork and communication**

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Teamwork and communication | Students can explain how **multiple team members contributed** to the robot design and game strategy. All students answer questions independently. | Students can explain how **most team members contributed** to the robot design and game strategy. Students support each other as needed to answer questions. | Only **one team member answered** questions or contributed to the robot design process. |

### Students can explain how multiple team members contributed to the design.
Explain each team members role on the team and how they contributed to the robot. For example, one team member might have designed the chassis, one the tower/lift, and the last programed it. This goes along with topic 3 and explaining how team members were assigned to tasks based on their skills

### All students answer questions independently.
You don’t want one team member talking the whole time, try to make sure every member speaks equally.

## Topic 5
**Respect and courtesy**

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Respect and courtesy | Students answer respectfully and courteously. Students **make sure each team member contributes**. Students wait to speak until others have finished. | Students answer respectfully and courteously. **Some students attempt to contribute** but are interrupted by other students. | Students **do not answer respectfully** and courteously. Students interrupt each other or the Judges. |

### Answer questions respectfully
Be sure to introduce yourself and make sure each team member speaks as with topic 4.

### Don’t interrupt.
My team had a good bit of trouble with this and that’s why we have everyone assigned to a category, it lessens the frequency of interruptions. If two people do try to speak at the same time, it’s okay just don’t have a really long awkward pause after waiting for someone to start speaking again
