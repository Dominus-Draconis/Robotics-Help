## Topic 1 Identify game and robot design challenges and goals

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Identify game and robot design challenges and goals | **Identifies** the game challenge or robot design challenge **in detail at the start of each design** process cycle with words and pictures. States the goals for accomplishing the challenge. | Identifies the challenge at the start of each design cycle. **Lacking details in words**, pictures, or goals. | **Does not identify the challenge** at the start of each design cycle. |

[Vex current game](https://www.vexrobotics.com/v5/competition/vrc-current-game)

At this website you will find a description of the game, details about scoring, and links to the most current game manual. I would recommend bookmarking this website as when the game manual is updated, links to the old version will die.

At the beginning of the notebook, describe the game and all its elements. I usually sketch out the field and all game elements and include dimensions. The game manual has some of this information but looking at the field specifications can also be quite helpful for exact dimensions and varied field views. Even if you do not include it in your notebook, knowing the sizes of elements is important information if you need to know how tall your arm needs to be or how wide an element is.

List key rules, this might include scoring rules, specific game rules, entrapment rules, or anything else you think is important. Make sure at least one person on your team has at least read the game manual and understands the game. Also be sure to list design constraints and be aware of them before you begin construction. As these are part of the challenge, they are important to include. List items such as the starting size limit, motor limit, or anything else that serves as a limitation on how you can build your robot.

Write down a design statement about what the goal of your robot is such as:
>Design, build, and compete with a robot that can [your goals] in the vex game […]

Also list strategies, this can include simple things such as being able to score points or complex strategies such as defensive ones or the order in which you want to score points. These strategies also function as goals about what you want your robot to do in more specific terms.
 
## Topic 2 Brainstorm and diagram or prototype solutions

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Brainstorm and diagram or prototype solutions | **Lists three or more possible solutions** to the challenge with labeled diagrams. Citations provided for ideas that came from outside sources such as online videos or other teams.	| **Lists one or two possible solutions** to the challenge. No citations provided for ideas that came from outside sources. | **Does not list** any solutions to the challenge. |

Before building you want to come up with at least 3 possible robot designs, it is okay to use designs you find online but be sure to cite your sources. I like to break up my designs into subsystems like the chassis, intakes, or tower.

For each design describe and sketch it out. Be sure to label where the motors are and other important elements such as wheels or gears. In addition to sketches, I like to provide a list of pros and cons as well as a short description. It is also possible to build a simple prototype of a solution and include images and results of any tests you run on the prototype.

## Topic 3 Select the best solution and plan
| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Select the best solution and plan	| Explains why the solution was selected through testing and/or a decision matrix. **Fully describes the plan** to implement the solution.	| Explains why the solution was selected. **Mentions the plan**. | **Does not explain** why the solution was selected or does not mention the plan. |

For each subsystem I list out applicable design constraints and criteria for the design based on the strategies previously listed. These criteria might include things like
>Must be able to lift element at least [height] inches high (for a lift/tower)

The criteria chosen for each subsystem will go on to form a decision matrix.

To make a decision matrix, put the criteria you want to judge the design by in the rows of a table and the design in the columns, then in each box evaluate the design on the criteria. Make sure you are consistent in how you score, either with higher being better or lower being better. If one criterion is more important, put it on a different scale, e.g. 1-10 instead of 1-5. Then add up each designs’ score and select the design with the highest total.

> | Criteria | Design #1 | Design #2 | Design #3 |
> | -------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
> | Crit. #1 (1-10)	| # | # | # |
> | Crit. #2 (1-10)	| # | # | # |
> | Crit. #3 (1-10)	| # | # | # |
> | Crit. #4 (1-10)	| # | # | # |
> | Crit. #5 (1-10)	| # | # | # |
> | Totals | 0 | 0 | 0|

After choosing the design, write a detailed description of the design and if possible, include sketches for the design. Mention how this design will be good at achieving the strategies you outlined previously. In order to get full points you must make a plan to implement the solution. Make a project timeline showing the order in which you wish to complete your robot. This can include specific details about what you wish to do, or an outline such as:
>On [day] we will start work on the chassis and gather materials for the arms.

Make the sketches as detailed as possible and try to include a list of parts you will need. This can be something like:
> - 15 hole long c-channel (*4)
> - 18 tooth gear (*2)

## Topic 4 Build and program the solution

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Build and program the solution | Records the steps to build and program the solution. Includes enough detail that the reader **could recreate the solution following the steps in the Notebook**. | Records the key steps to build and program the solution. **Lacks sufficient detail to recreate the solution**. | **Does not record the key steps** to build and program the solution. |

Record all the steps you take to build the robot. You should do this through daily entries describing all changes made to the robot and why in as much detail as possible. As the rubric says,
>"Includes enough detail that the reader could recreate the solution following the steps in the notebook"

This means you should be incredibly specific about the sizes and materials of the pieces you use. If you do change your design, provide updated sketches when possible. Pictures of construction are incredibly helpful but when you include pictures use them together with words and descriptions of what is in the picture. However, pictures are not as helpful as a good sketch. If you don’t have a picture or drawing skills, even a simple sketch can help you describe what changes you made to the robot.

In addition to documenting changes to the robot, provide code to your robot or just any changed sections. When including code, either use comments in your code as is good practice or write in notes about the code after putting it in the notebook. I would not recommend writing out the code in your notebook but instead printing it out.

[Guide to Printing Code](https://github.com/Dominus-Draconis/Robotics-Help/blob/main/Notebook-and-Interview/printing-code.md)

## Topic 5 Test solution

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Test solution | **Records all the steps** to test the solution, including test results. | **Records the key steps** to test the solution. | **Does not record the steps** to test the solution. |

Record all steps to test the solution including test results. During the design process, test out the solution and include these tests and results in the notebook. Describe how you tested it, with steps as well as results and what you gained from it. If it was a failure, describe what you will change and you might have to go back and brainstorm solutions.

For example, after the chassis is finished, test it out by driving it around to ensure the chassis, code, motors and cortex all are in working condition. This is also helpful because if one of those does not work, it is generally easier to fix before the rest of the robot has been built.

Other tests might include testing if a lift is high enough including measurements or testing if it has enough power to lift game elements.

Testing is also a key part in programming an autonomous. It will likely not work the first time and will go through many iterations before you get a consistently working autonomous and these iterations and changes can be recorded as testing in the notebook.

## Topic 6 Repeat design process

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Repeat design process | Shows that the **design process is repeated multiple times** to improve performance on an individual design goal or overall robot or game performance. | Shows that the **design process is not often repeated** for individual design goals or overall robot or game performance. | **Does not show that the design process is repeated.** |

After tests, you might realize you need to rework your design. If you do this, make sure to repeat the brainstorming and design process if you are completely re-making your robot. If you are changing something smaller than a subsystem of a robot, mention what you did and why, and why that solution was better than other ones

You might also find you want to change an element of the robot after a competition if you saw a better design or if your design did not work.

This topic and the previous work together because often if you test a solution and it does not work you will have to repeat the design process.

## Topic 7 Usefulness and repeatability

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Usefulness and repeatability | **Records the entire design and development process** in such great clarity and detail that the reader could recreate the project’s history and build the current robot from the notebook. | Records the design and development process completely but **lacks sufficient detail** to fully recreate the entire project or robot. | Does not record the design and development process or **lacks sufficient detail** to understand the design process. |

This topic is essentially a sum of previous topics. If you write detailed daily entries and get the points for other topics, you should be able to do well in this category. As before, include plenty of detail such that a reader could recreate your robot from your notebook.

## Topic 8 Record of team and project management

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Record of team and project management | Provides a **complete record of team and project assignments**; a bound notebook should be in ink; notes from team meetings including goals, decisions, and accomplishments; name or initials of author; each page numbered and dated. Design cycles are easily identified. Includes Table of Contents and/or Index so anyone can easily locate needed information. | Records **most of the information listed** at the left. Not written in ink. Organized so that team members can locate most of the needed information. | Does not record most of the information listed at the left. Not organized; needed information difficult to locate. |

I like to make a timeline between competitions, but you could do one every month or week as you see fit. Write down what you want to have accomplished after each meeting or week depending on the scale of the plan, and the more detail the better, e.g., Person X will do task Y on day Z.

If your plans change or you decide to switch designs, make a new timeline. Your timeline could be list or shared excel doc, or whatever you want, but be sure to include a record of it in your notebook. Also make sure to include notes about who did what during each team meeting to show team management.

Notes from each team meeting should include goals, decisions, and accomplishments. I like to break my notes from team meetings up into categories, I start with the goal for the day as listed in the timeline, maybe with more specific detail added, then do sections for brainstorming, building, testing, programming, or anything else. These sections are based on the criteria from the rubric to make it easier for the judges to see the parts of the design process.

Notebook should be professional:
- Rubric includes several points about how the notebook should be formatted
- Use pen when writing, this is to ensure you cannot go back and change everything. If you make a mistake when writing cross, it out with a single line
- Daily entries should include initials from the author and each page should be numbered and dated
- Notebook should include a table of contents or index listing the locations of important information so it can easily be found
- It can also be nice to include tabs for any major events, I put tabs at every competition, the start of a new design cycle, robot code, and anything else that is important or listed on the rubric

Design Cycles should be easily identifiable. List the start of any new design cycles in the table of contents and try to label so it’s easily recognizable

## Topic 9 Notebook construction

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Notebook construction | Five (5) points if notebook is bound. If a Digital Engineering Notebook or a printed copy of one, five (5) points if the entries contain a time stamp that can be confirmed. | Zero points for any other notebook. | Zero points for any other notebook. |

You get 5 points for either a bound notebook or a digital one with confirmable time stamp, I don’t know if the digital notebook convention will last, as it was not a thing previous years.

# The Interview
![Interview Rubric](/assets/interview-rubric.png)

[Rubrics](https://github.com/Dominus-Draconis/Robotics-Help/blob/main/Notebook-and-Interview/rubrics.pdf)  
As a team look over and discuss the team interview Rubric, this will help give you an idea of what to talk about.

[Judge Guide](https://github.com/Dominus-Draconis/Robotics-Help/blob/main/Notebook-and-Interview/judge-guide.pdf)  
It can also be helpful to look over the judge guide to help prepare. The judges guide contains more detailed specifics of what the judges are looking for in particular awards and has some example interview questions that it can be helpful to look over for an idea of what the judges might ask you.

I would recommend assigning certain topics to the different members of your team. This will help ensure everyone speaks for similar lengths of time and will help minimize interruptions.

Make sure to introduce yourself to the judges, just your names are enough, but it can be helpful to also state your roles, e.g. builder, programmer, driver, scribe

The judges often ask the first question “So, tell us about your robot”, make sure you prepare for this type of open ended question and make sure to also be prepared for follow up questions about your specific answers.
   
## Topic 1 Design process and Engineering Notebook

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Design process and Engineering Notebook | Students **clearly explain all aspects of the design process** and how they recorded their use of the design process in the Notebook. | Students can **explain most aspects of the design process** and how they recorded their use of the process. | Students **can explain only limited aspects of the design** process and how they recorded their use of the process. |

### Students clearly explain all aspects of the design process.
Talk about your design process, or how you went from brainstorming to choosing a design to building the design. You can explain how you brainstormed designs then choose between them with a decision matrix. I would recommend the person who writes your notebook talking about this topic as they probably know the most about it.

## Topic 2 Game strategies and robot designs

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Game strategies and robot designs | Students can describe **three or more game strategies** and robot designs that were considered; students can fully explain how and why the current game strategy and robot design were chosen. | Students can describe **two game strategies** and robot designs that were considered; students can explain how and why the current game strategy or robot design were chosen. | Students can describe **only their current game strategy** and design, or they cannot explain how and why the current game strategy or robot design were chosen. |

### Students can describe three or more game strategies.
Make sure to mention at least 3 game strategies, these will be the ones you hopefully recorded at the beginning of your notebook. My team always likes to say *“our first strategy is, …”* to make it clear to the judges what we are doing.

If there are strategies that you considered but don’t use, talk about them and why you don’t use them, for example if you don’t play defense, you could talk about how you are bad at driving defense or your chassis is too slow to stop robots, or your chassis is too weak to push robots. My team usually has each person responsible for saying a strategy when the time is right in conversation

### Students can describe three or more robot designs that were considered.
Also mention at least 3 robot designs that you considered, including your current one, again these should be in your notebook’s brainstorming at the beginning. Talk about why those designs wouldn’t be as effective or talk about old designs you tried but didn’t work. My team had one person explain all the robot designs.

## Topic 3 Project and team management

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Project and team management | Students can explain **how team progress was tracked against an overall project timeline**, and how students were assigned to tasks based on their skills and availability; students can explain management of material resources. | Students can explain **how team progress was monitored**, or how students were assigned to tasks, or management of material resources. | Students **cannot explain how team progress was monitored** or how students were assigned to tasks or how material resources were managed. |

### Students can explain how progress was tracked against an overall project timeline.
Talk about the timelines you should have included in your notebook and how you use these to maximize your time. For example, you could mention how at the beginning of each meeting you look at what the timeline says your goal is for the meeting and reassess the goal to track your progress.

### Students can explain management of materials and students.
Talk about how each person on your team’s time was managed well, for example, maybe your main builder was working on the chassis while the programmer war programing. Also talk about how you managed if certain team members were absent. Mention any problems you might have had with not finding the parts you need or how you planned out getting the parts you need.

## Topic 4 Teamwork and communication

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Teamwork and communication | Students can explain how **multiple team members contributed** to the robot design and game strategy. All students answer questions independently. | Students can explain how **most team members contributed** to the robot design and game strategy. Students support each other as needed to answer questions. | Only **one team member answered** questions or contributed to the robot design process. |

### Students can explain how multiple team members contributed to the design.
Explain each team members role on the team and how they contributed to the robot. For example, one team member might have designed the chassis, one the tower/lift, and the last programed it. This goes along with topic 3 and explaining how team members were assigned to tasks based on their skills

### All students answer questions independently.
You don’t want one team member talking the whole time, try to make sure every member speaks equally.

## Topic 5 Respect and courtesy

| Topic | Expert (4-5) | Proficient (2-3) | Emerging (0-1) |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------|
| Respect and courtesy | Students answer respectfully and courteously. Students **make sure each team member contributes**. Students wait to speak until others have finished. | Students answer respectfully and courteously. **Some students attempt to contribute** but are interrupted by other students. | Students **do not answer respectfully** and courteously. Students interrupt each other or the Judges. |

### Answer questions respectfully.
Be sure to introduce yourself and make sure each team member speaks as with topic 4.

### Don’t interrupt.
My team had a good bit of trouble with this and that’s why we have everyone assigned to a category, it lessens the frequency of interruptions. If two people do try to speak at the same time, it’s okay just don’t have a really long awkward pause after waiting for someone to start speaking again
