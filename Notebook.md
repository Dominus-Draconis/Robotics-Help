At this website you will find a description of the game, details about scoring, and links to the most current game manual. I would recommend bookmarking this website as when the game manual is updated, links to the old version will die.
At the beginning of the notebook, describe the game and all its elements. I usually sketch out the field and all game elements and include dimensions. The game manual has some of this information but looking at the field specifications can also be quite helpful for exact dimensions and varied field views. Even if you do not include it in your notebook, knowing the sizes of elements is important information if you need to know how tall your arm needs to be or how wide an element is.
List key rules, this might include scoring rules, specific game rules, entrapment rules, or anything else you think is important. Make sure at least one person on your team has at least read the game manual and understands the game. Also be sure to list design constraints and be aware of them before you begin construction. As these are part of the challenge, they are important to include. List items such as the starting size limit, motor limit, or anything else that serves as a limitation on how you can build your robot.
Write down a design statement about what the goal of your robot is such as:
Design, build, and compete with a robot that can [your goals] in the vex game […]
Also list strategies, this can include simple things such as being able to score pints or complex strategies such as defensive ones or the order in which you want to score points. These strategies also function as goals about what you want your robot to do in more specific terms.

 
Topic 2: Brainstorm and diagram or prototype solutions
	Brainstorm and diagram or prototype solutions 	Lists three or more possible solutions to the challenge with labeled diagrams. Citations provided for ideas that came from outside sources such as online videos or other teams.	Lists one or two possible solutions to the challenge. No citations provided for ideas that came from outside sources.	Does not list any solutions to the challenge.

Before building you want to come up with at least 3 possible robot designs, it is okay to use designs you find online but be sure to cite your sources. I like to break up my designs into subsystems like the chassis, intakes, or tower.
For each design describe and sketch it out. Be sure to label where the motors are and other important elements such as wheels or gears. In addition to sketches, I like to provide a list of pros and cons as well as a short description. It is also possible to build a simple prototype of a solution and include images and results of any tests you run on the prototype.

 
Topic 3: Select the best solution and plan
	Select the best solution and plan	Explains why the solution was selected through testing and/or a decision matrix. Fully describes the plan to implement the solution.	Explains why the solution was selected. Mentions the plan.	Does not explain why the solution was selected or does not mention the plan.

	For each subsystem I list out applicable design constraints and criteria for the design based on the strategies previously listed. These criteria might include things like
Must be able to lift element at least [height] inches high (for a lift/tower)
The criteria chosen for each subsystem will go on to form a decision matrix.
	To make a decision matrix, put the criteria you want to judge the design by in the rows of a table and the design in the columns, then in each box evaluate the design on the criteria. Make sure you are consistent in how you score, either with higher being better or lower being better. If one criterion is more important, put it on a different scale, e.g. 1-10 instead of 1-5. Then add up each designs’ score and select the design with the highest total.
Criteria	Design #1	Design #2	Design #3
Crit. #1 (1-10)	#	#	#
Crit. #2 (1-10)	#	#	#
Crit. #3 (1-10)	#	#	#
Crit. #4 (1-10)	#	#	#
Crit. #5 (1-10)	#	#	#
Totals	0	0	0









After choosing the design, write a detailed description of the design and if possible, include sketches for the design. Mention how this design will be good at achieving the strategies you outlined previously. In order to get full points you must make a plan to implement the solution. Make a project timeline showing the order in which you wish to complete your robot. This can include specific details about what you wish to do, or an outline such as:
On [day] we will start work on the chassis and gather materials for the arms.
Make the sketches as detailed as possible and try to include a list of parts you will need. This can be something like:
-15 hole long c-channel (*4)
-18 tooth gear (*2)
 
Topic 4: Build and program the solution
	Build and program the solution	Records the steps to build and program the solution. Includes enough detail that the reader could recreate the solution following the steps in the Notebook.	Records the key steps to build and program the solution. Lacks sufficient detail to recreate the solution.	Does not record the key steps to build and program the solution.

Record all the steps you take to build the robot. You should do this through daily entries describing all changes made to the robot and why in as much detail as possible. As the rubric says,
Includes enough detail that the reader could recreate the solution following the steps in the notebook”.
This means you should be incredibly specific about the sizes and materials of the pieces you use. If you do change your design, provide updated sketches when possible. Pictures of construction are incredibly helpful but when you include pictures use them together with words and descriptions of what is in the picture. However, pictures are not as helpful as a good sketch. If you don’t have a picture or drawing skills, even a simple sketch can help you describe what changes you made to the robot.
	In addition to documenting changes to the robot, provide code to your robot or just any changed sections. When including code, either use comments in your code as is good practice or write in notes about the code after putting it in the notebook. I would not recommend writing out the code in your notebook but instead printing it out.
	To print code on a mac, use homebrew to install enscript, then use enscript to  print the code.
lilia@Deep-Thought ~ % brew install enscript
lilia@Deep-Thought ~ % enscript --color -CE -p code.ps main.cpp

 
Topic 5: Test solution
	Test solution	Records all the steps to test the solution, including test results.	Records the key steps to test the solution.	Does not record the steps to test the
solution.

Record all steps to test the solution including test results. During the design process, test out the solution and include these tests and results in the notebook. Describe how you tested it, with steps as well as results and what you gained from it. If it was a failure, describe what you will change and you might have to go back and brainstorm solutions.
For example, after the chassis is finished, test it out by driving it around to ensure the chassis, code, motors and cortex all are in working condition. This is also helpful because if one of those does not work, it is generally easier to fix before the rest of the robot has been built.
Other tests might include testing if a lift is high enough including measurements or testing if it has enough power to lift game elements.
Testing is also a key part in programming an autonomous. It will likely not work the first time and will go though many iterations before you get a consistently working autonomous and these iterations and changes can be recorded as testing in the notebook.

Topic 6: Repeat design process
	Repeat design process	Shows that the design process is repeated multiple times to improve performance on an individual design goal or overall robot or game performance.	Shows that the design process is not often repeated for individual design goals or overall robot or game performance.	Does not show that the design process is repeated.

After tests, you might realize you need to rework your design. If you do this, make sure to repeat the brainstorming and design process if you are completely re-making your robot. If you are changing something smaller than a subsystem of a robot, mention what you did and why, and why that solution was better than other ones
You might also find you want to change an element of the robot after a competition if you saw a better design or if your design did not work.
This topic and the previous work together because often if you test a solution and it does not work you will have to repeat the design prosses.


Topic 7: Usefulness and repeatability
Usefulness and repeatability	Records the entire design and development process in such great clarity and detail that the reader could recreate the project’s history and build the current robot from the notebook.	Records the design and development process completely but lacks sufficient detail to fully recreate the entire project or robot.	Does not record the design and development process or lacks sufficient detail to understand the design process.
o	Records the entire design process
o	Very similar to topic 4, make sure to write detailed daily entries, as mentioned earlier, the reader should be able to recreate the robot from your notebook


Topic 8: Record of team and project management
Record of team and project management	Provides a complete record of team and project assignments; a bound notebook should be in ink; notes from team meetings including goals, decisions, and accomplishments; name or initials of author; each page numbered and dated. Design cycles are easily identified. Includes Table of Contents and/or Index so anyone can easily locate needed information.	Records most of the information listed at the left. Not written in ink. Organized so that team members can locate most of the needed information.	Does not record most of the information listed at the left. Not organized; needed information difficult to locate.
o	Provides a complete record of team and project assignments
	I like to make a timeline between competitions, but you could do one every month or week as you see fit
	Write down what you want to have accomplished after each meeting and the more detail the better, e.g., Person X will do task Y on day Z
	If your plans change or you decide to switch designs, make a new timeline
	Timeline could be list or shared excel doc, or whatever you want, but be sure to include a record of it in your notebook
	Also make sure to include notes about who did what during each team meeting
o	Notes from each team meeting should include goals, decisions, and accomplishments.
	I like to break my notes from team meetings up into categories, I start with the goal for the day as listed in the timeline, maybe with more specific detail added, then do sections for brainstorming, building, testing, programming, or anything else. These sections are based on the criteria from the rubric to make it easier for the judges to see the parts of the design process.
o	Notebook should be professional
	Rubric includes several points about how the notebook should be formatted
	Use pen when writing, this is to ensure you cannot go back and change everything. If you make a mistake when writing cross, it out with a single line
	Daily entries should include initials from the author and each page should be numbered and dated
	Notebook should include a table of contents or index listing the locations of important information so it can easily be found
	It can also be nice to include tabs for any major events, I put tabs at every competition, the start of a new design cycle, robot code, and anything else that is important or listed on the rubric
o	Design Cycles should be easily identifiable
	List the start of any new design cycles in the table of contents and try to label so it’s easily recognizable
Topic 9: Notebook construction
Notebook construction	Five (5) points if notebook is bound. If a Digital Engineering Notebook or a printed copy of one, five (5) points if the entries contain a time stamp that can be confirmed.	Zero points for any other notebook.	Zero points for any other notebook.
o	You get 5 points for either a bound notebook or a digital one with confirmable time stamp
