# Programming

This is the code from my robot gregor, it is organized into 4 files
*  `autons.cpp` - Has functions for different autons to run from different parts of the field or for different point values
*  `declarations.cpp` - Declares motors on the robot, the chassis from Okapi, and functions used in the autons like score()
*  `main.cpp` - The main body of the code. Has code for driver control and is where the auton functions are called for the game
*  `header.h` - Allows the main file to access the declarations and functions from other files

Okapi is a library to help program the robot, it especialy helps with the chassis
