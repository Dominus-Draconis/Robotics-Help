An alternative to VEX code, I prefer it and think it is easier to use.

[Engineering Notebook](https://www.amazon.com/Vela-Sciences-Advanced-ProCover-inches/dp/B01LZP2XPH/ref=sr_1_41?dchild=1&keywords=engineering+notebook&qid=1594689807&sr=8-41)
The notebooks provided by vex work well, but I like hardcover notebooks like this one which has many other useful features such as a table of contents and places for witness signatures.

[Judging Materials](https://www.roboticseducation.org/resources_library/judge-guide/)
Has links to the judge guide and notebook and interview rubrics, should be more up to date copies.

VEX via app
Shows you match schedules, tournament rankings, skills rankings, and award winners at competitions.

VRC Hub app
Has a copy of the field manual and a scoring system so you don't have to do the sums in your head.
